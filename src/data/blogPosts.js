# The Ultimate Guide to Indoor Plant Care

Indoor plants bring life, color, and fresh air to our homes. But keeping them healthy requires understanding their unique needs.

## Understanding Light Requirements

- **Low light plants**: Pothos, Snake Plant, ZZ Plant
- **Medium light plants**: Monstera, Peace Lily, Spider Plant

## Watering Wisdom

The most common mistake is overwatering. Here's how to avoid it:

1. Check the soil moisture before watering
2. Use well-draining pots with drainage holes
3. Water thoroughly but infrequently
4. Adjust watering based on the season

## Humidity and Temperature

Most indoor plants thrive in:
- Temperature: 65-75°F (18-24°C)
- Humidity: 40-60%

Increase humidity by:
- Grouping plants together
- Using a pebble tray
- Misting regularly
- Using a humidifier

## Fertilizing

Feed your plants during the growing season (spring and summer):
- Use balanced, water-soluble fertilizer
- Dilute to half strength
- Apply every 2-4 weeks
- Reduce or stop in fall and winter

Remember, each plant is unique. Observe your plants and adjust care as needed!
